        <p>The goal of this guide is to help you pick the best API to communicate with a hardware device (e.g. webcam, microphone, etc.) on the web. By "best" I mean it gives you everything you need with the shortest amount of work. In other words, you know the general use case you want to solve (e.g. accessing video) but you don't know what API to use or wonder if there's another way to achieve it.
<br><br>
            One problem that I commonly see web developers fall into is jumping into low-level APIs without learning about the higher-level APIs that are easier to implement and provide a better UX. Therefore, this guide starts by recommending higher-level APIs first, but also mentions lower-level APIs in case you have determined that the higher-level API doesn't meet your needs.
            <br><br>
            Try listening for Keyboard and Pointer events. If this device is a game controller, use the Gamepad API to know which buttons are being pressed and which axes moved.
            <br><br>
            If none of these options work for you, a low-level API may be the solution. Check out Discover how to communicate with your device to start your journey.
            <br><br>
            
            Use MediaDevices.getUserMedia() to get live audio and video streams from this device and learn about capturing audio and video. You can also control the camera's pan, tilt, and zoom, and other camera settings such as brightness and contrast, and even take still images. Web Audio can be used to add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, or apply spatial effects (such as panning). Check out how to profile the performance of Web Audio apps in Chrome as well.
            <br><br>
            If none of these options work for you, a low-level API may be the solution. Check out Discover how to communicate with your device to start your journey.
            
           <br><br>
            Use window.print() to open a browser dialog that lets the user pick this device as a destination to print the current document.
            <br><br>
            If this doesn't work for you, a low-level API may be the solution. Check out Discover how to communicate with your device to start your journey.
            <br><br>
            
            Use WebAuthn to create a strong, attested, and origin-scoped public-key credential with this hardware security device to authenticate users. It supports the use of Bluetooth, NFC, and USB-roaming U2F or FIDO2 authenticators —also known as security keys— as well as a platform authenticator, which lets users authenticate with their fingerprints or screen locks. Check out Build your first WebAuthn app.
            <br><br>
            If this device is another type of hardware security device (e.g. a cryptocurrency wallet), a low-level API may be the solution. Check out Discover how to communicate with your device to start your journey</p>

        <p>The efforts on coronavirus vaccine began initially in China as soon as the outbreak of coronavirus erupted and then world-over as the disease was declared a pandemic by WHO. Eventually, each country got into the race of developing the vaccine to be 1st in the world to safeguard its population & have an advantage over other countries. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Covid 19 pandemic is raging, even escalating. That puts pressure on all the countries to rush for a covid vaccine. Under such pressure, countries may authorize emergency use of a vaccine on specified groups without waiting for the completion of Phase III trials which could be harmful. We all have shown great patience till now, let’s continue the same by taking all the safety measures & following Government guidelines. <br></p>
