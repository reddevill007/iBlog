        <p>When Hillary Clinton visited India in 2009, the US Secretary of State’s verdict was unequivocal: ‘I consider
            India not just a regional power, but a global power.’ Eight years earlier, on the back of economic liberalisation
            <br><br>
            in the 1990s, India had been included among the ‘BRICs’ – those developing nations whose economic
            potential was expected to take them to the heights of the world economy. Since the turn of the century,
            India’s economy has surpassed those predictions, expanding fourfold in the course of a decade. Over the
            same time, expectations that India might increasingly define its political interests to match its economic
            clout have in turn grown, particularly in a West that sees in India’s democratic heritage the potential
            for strategic partnership. Indeed, for some Indian newspapers the question of India’s rise is essentially
            settled; all that is left to consider is what kind of superpower India wants to become.
            India’s rise has certainly been impressive, and warrants the attention that it has commanded. India
            has been one of the world’s best-performing economies for a quarter of a century, lifting millions out
            of poverty and becoming the world’s third-largest economy in PPP terms. India has tripled its defence
            expenditure over the last decade to become one of the top-ten military spenders. And in stark contrast
            to Asia’s other billion-person emerging power, India has simultaneously cultivated an attractive global
            image of social and cultural dynamism.
            <br><br>
            India’s rise in geostrategic terms is rendered all the more significant since its power resides at the confluence
            <br><br>
            of the United States’ two great hegemonic challenges: counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan and
            Pakistan, and the management of China’s growing regional assertiveness. If India’s proud nonalignment
            during the Cold War had given it a leadership role in the developing world, its 21st century position places
            it at the heart of superpower geopolitics. Barack Obama’s enthusiastic endorsement of a permanent
            UN security council seat for India, as part of making the US-India relationship ‘a defining partnership of
            the century ahead’, speaks volumes for the global importance of how India defines its foreign policy.
            Still, for all India’s success, its undoubted importance and despite its undisputed potential, there is
            cause for caution in assessing India’s claim to superpower status. India still faces major developmental
            challenges. The still-entrenched divisions of caste structure are being compounded by the emergence
            of new inequalities of wealth stemming from India’s economic success. India’s democracy may have
            thrived in a manner that few ever expected, but its institutions face profound challenges from embedded
            nepotism and corruption. India’s economic success continues to come with an environmental cost that
            is unsustainable.
            <br><br>
            Moreover, India has pressing security preoccupations. Domestically, insurgent violence affects large
            parts of India, creating risks and imposing additional costs on investment and economic development.
            Longstanding disputes necessitate that India focus its security concerns on its immediate borders and
            near-abroad, stymying efforts to define its strategic interests in a broader regional or global context.
            India’s military capabilities, though growing, reflect the consequentially narrow bureaucratic concerns
            which India’s institutional structures struggle to transcend.</p>
